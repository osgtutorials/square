This contains the code exactly from https://bjornblissing.github.io/openscenegraph-tutorials/basic_geometry/basic_geometry.md.html
Except for one typo correction in the header statements.

Additionally, a working makefile is included.
If you compiled OpenSceneGraph from source, you'll need to modify OSG_DIR in makefile.
